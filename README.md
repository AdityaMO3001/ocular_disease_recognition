# Ocular Disease Recognition Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the application of data mining and machine learning techniques for the precise diagnosis of ocular diseases. Using the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, we address critical challenges like image variability, label accuracy, class imbalance, and the ethical handling of sensitive medical data. Our ultimate goal is to develop a robust and efficient system for better disease detection, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and ethical integrity.

## Problem Statement

The ODIR dataset represents real-world patient information collected from multiple hospitals and medical centers. It includes color fundus photographs and diagnostic keywords provided by medical professionals. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing advanced machine learning models aimed at assisting healthcare professionals in the early and accurate detection of various ocular diseases.

## Key Objectives

Address the challenges of image source diversity and label accuracy.

Develop machine learning models to enhance diagnostic precision.

Transform the ODIR dataset into a pivotal resource for ongoing research and medical diagnosis.

Create an effective system for improved and accurate disease detection.

## Dataset

The ODIR dataset consists of:

5,000 patient records with demographic details.

Color fundus images captured using diverse medical imaging devices.

### Diagnostic annotations categorized into eight distinct ocular conditions:

Normal (N)

Diabetes (D)

Glaucoma (G)

Cataract (C)

Age-related Macular Degeneration (A)

Hypertension (H)

Pathological Myopia (M)

Other diseases/abnormalities (O)
